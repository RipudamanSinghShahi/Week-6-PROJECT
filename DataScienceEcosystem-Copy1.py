# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python:

# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers

# In[4]:


(3*4)+5


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60 and displaying result with upto two decimal places

# In[5]:


minutes = 200 
hours = minutes / 60

print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours:.2f} hours")


# **Objectives**
# 
# In this Notebook, We covered the following key Takeaways:
# 
# -List of pupular programming languages commonly used by data scientests in thier day to day work.
# 
# -Overview of essential librabies frequestly employed in data science tasks.
# 
# -Demonstrated caculations using Jupyter Notebook for task such as data conversion(Minutes to Hours) and data calulation
# 
# Feel free to apply these concepts to you Data Science learning journey! Wishing you a great day ahead!
